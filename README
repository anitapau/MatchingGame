Go to the the html file and run it in the browser
You'll notice a set of smiley faces on each side of the game board 
Click on the extra smiley face on the left side of the game board that is missing on the right side
If you click the right smiley face, you progress to the next level
On each level, more smiley faces are added, making it more difficult to find the extra smiley face
If you click on the wrong face, game over


Have fun!
